What is this? 

JavaScript: Password Generator

Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

Ricardo L. Russ

Features:

Creates a dynamic password generator that will create a secure password that matches the user'specifications. 

Options for inclusion into the password include lowercase, Uppercase, numerals, and special characters.

The password generator also features a length function, which will decide the lenghth of the password. However, the password cannot be below 8 characters or above 128 characters, for security and storage reasons, respectively. 

The password generator was entirely coded using Javascript, so changes can be made to the index.html and the style.css without interfering with the function of the generator.

To-Do list: 

1. Fix various errors within the generatePassword function that causes the upperCaseCharacters to function to occasionally override the other functions which govern password character selection. 

2. Add support for other alphabets and character sets.
